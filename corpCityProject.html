                                    The project was developed in Unity and we had to rebuild from the ground the game that was made in 2 years in just 6 months, both client and server. We manage to do it and 
                                    I was in charged of almost 75% of the client, creating architectures for the client and integrating our custom rendering pipeline. Also did a bit of the serverin Go. Unfortunatly, 
                                    the game was cancelled 2 weeks before the soft launch.
